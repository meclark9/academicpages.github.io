M.S Chemical Oceanography
======
My master's research at the University of Maine focuses on the transport and fate of microplastics in the North Atlantic.
I work with Dr. Margaret Estapa to understand how the biological carbon pump can influence the transport of plastic.


B.S Biology
======
I did my undergraduate degree in biology at the University of Alaska Southeast in Juneau, Alaska. My research here was on the spatiotemporal variation of fjords.
